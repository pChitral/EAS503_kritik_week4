    "\n",
    "We covered list and dictionary comprehension. There are three variations of list/dictionary comprehension: no conditional, if conditional, and if/else conditional. Give simple examples where you do not use list/dictionary comprehension and then repeat the same examples with list/dictionary comprehension. There will be 12 examples in total -- 3 plain list example, 3 list comprehension examples, 3 plain dictionary examples, and 3 dictionary comprehensions examples.\n",

    "A student comes to you and says that they used Python to simulate 10 coin tosses and got observed 7 heads and 3 tails. They tell you that something is wrong with Python. Are they correct? Explain in detail.\n",

    "Question 3\n",
    "----------\n",

    "Explain the purpose of `continue` and `break` in looping.\n",

    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume there is a csv file whose first line is the column headers and the rest of the rows are values. How can you use zip to create a list in which each element is a dictionary whose keys are the column headers and values are the values from the rows? Hint: I am asking you to basically explain the following code that we covered in lecture.\n",
